    <h2>Synopsis</h2>
    <div class="paragraph-background">
      <p>
        The game is set in the Continent, a fictional fantasy world based on
        Slavonic mythology.It is surrounded by parallel dimensions and
        extra-dimensional worlds. Humans, elves, dwarves, monsters and other
        creatures co-exist on the Continent, but non-humans are often persecuted
        for their differences.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Continent is caught up in a war between the empire of Nilfgaard—led
        by Emperor Emhyr var Emreis (Charles Dance), who invaded the Northern
        Kingdoms—and Redania, ruled by King Radovid V. Several locations appear,
        including the free city of Novigrad, the Redanian city of Oxenfurt, the
        no man's land of Velen, the city of Vizima (former capital of the
        recently conquered Temeria), the Skellige islands (home to several
        Norse-Gaels Viking clans) and the witcher stronghold of Kaer Morhen.

      The main character is the Witcher, Geralt of Rivia (Doug Cockle), a
      monster hunter trained since childhood in combat, tracking, alchemy and
      magic, and made stronger, faster and resistant to toxins by mutagens. He
      is aided by his lover, the powerful sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg
      (Denise Gough), his former love interest Triss Merigold (Jaimi
      Barbakoff),[38] the bard Dandelion (John Schwab), the dwarf warrior Zoltan
      Chivay (Alexander Morton), and Geralt's Witcher mentor Vesemir (William
      Roberts). Geralt is spurred into action by the reappearance of his and
      Yennefer's adopted daughter, Ciri (Jo Wyatt). Ciri is a Source, born with
      innate (and potentially vast) magical abilities; after the apparent death
      of her parents, she was trained as a witcher while Yennefer taught her
      magic. Ciri disappeared years before to escape the Wild Hunt, a group of
      spectral warriors led by the King of the Wild Hunt: the elf Eredin, from a
      parallel dimension
