        The Witcher is a series of fantasy action role-playing games developed
        by CD Projekt Red and published by CD Projekt. It is based on the book
        series of the same name by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski, acting as
        sequels to the story of the books.
      </p>

      <p>
        The main series began in 2007 with the release of The Witcher, and
        concluded with 2015's The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. As of 2020, the series
        has three main standalone games, two expansion packs and six spin-off
        games. The series is critically acclaimed and commercially successful,
        selling over 50 million copies worldwide by May 2020.
      </p>

      <p>
        March 2022 a fourth main instalment of the franchise was announced to be
        in early development. It will use Unreal Engine 5 instead of REDengine
        that the two previous games used

        <p>
          Set in the Continent of the Witcher franchise, the player assumes the
          role of Geralt of Rivia, a wandering genetically enhanced monster
          hunter for hire. The game takes place directly after the events of The
          Lady of the Lake. Geralt is accompanied by his longtime allies and
          fellow Witchers, Eskel, Lambert, and instructor Vesemir, as well as
          sorceress Triss Merigold of Maribor and the field medic Shani.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, characters in the game originally from the books include
          Geralt's companions Dandelion the poet, Zoltan Chivay, the regent King
          Foltest of Temeria, his daughter Princess Adda (who was previously
          cursed into the form of a striga but was cured by Geralt), King
          Radovid of Redania, and the spectral King of the Wild Hunt, a
          conqueror from another world. Characters original to the game include
          the boy Alvin, the sorcerer Azar Javed, the mercenary Professor, and
          Jacques de Alderberg, the Grand Master of the religious faction Order
          of the Flaming Rose.

        <br />
        <p class="witcher-1-paragraphs">Plot</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Geralt awakens at the School of the Wolf's mountain fortress Kaer
          Morhen, with no memory of who he is or how he is to have arrived
          there. He is taken in by his Witcher brothers as well as Triss
          Merigold, who seeks a remedy for his mysterious condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kaer Morhen is suddenly attacked by an unknown group of assailants,
          who escape with the School of the Wolf's key mutagens and formulae
          that detail how to create Witchers. Pursuing this faction, Geralt
          travels to the Temerian capital Vizima. On the way, he saves Alvin, a
          magically gifted peasant child. Triss determines that Alvin is a
          Source, a genetic magic prodigy similar to Ciri, Geralt's foster
          daughter. The player has the choice of leaving Alvin in the care of
          either Triss or Shani, a Redanian medic and Geralt's friend. Alvin is
          given a magical amulet meant to keep his abilities in check while he
          learns magic.

          Over the course of the game, the paths available to Geralt multiply.
          The two major paths follow Geralt's choice of ally: Vernon Roche or
          Iorveth. This choice has the greatest impact on how the game develops,
          but before making this choice, he must decide what to do about Aryan
          La Valette.

        <p class="witcher-1-paragraphs">Plot</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          At the start of the game, Geralt is in prison under suspicion of
          assassinating Foltest, the king of Temeria. The head of the Temerian
          special forces, Vernon Roche, interrogates Geralt and learns the story
          that led from Geralt being Foltest's right-hand man to a prisoner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to and during the events of The Witcher, Foltest had a secret
          relationship with a baroness named Maria Louisa La Valette, which led
          to two children, Anais and Boussy. Some time after Geralt saved
          Foltest from a witcher assassin (at the end of The Witcher), Foltest
          attempted to claim his children and bring them to live with him in
          Vizima. Maria was not willing to give up the children, and Foltest
          waged a war to claim them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Geralt succeeded in escorting Foltest to his children, but an unknown
          assailant kills Foltest before disappearing, leaving Geralt the only
          suspect. After the interrogation, Roche decides that Geralt is
          innocent and aids him in escaping the prison. The two, along with
          sorceress Triss Merigold, go in search of the kingslayer.

          The game is set in the Continent, a fictional fantasy world based on
          Slavonic mythology. It is surrounded by parallel dimensions and
          extra-dimensional worlds. Humans, elves, dwarves, monsters and other
          creatures co-exist on the Continent, but non-humans are often
          persecuted for their differences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Continent is caught up in a war between the empire of
          Nilfgaard—led by Emperor Emhyr var Emreis (Charles Dance),who invaded
          the Northern Kingdoms—and Redania, ruled by King Radovid V. Several
          locations appear, including the free city of Novigrad, the Redanian
          city of Oxenfurt, the no man's land of Velen, the city of Vizima
          (former capital of the recently conquered Temeria), the Skellige
          islands (home to several Norse-Gaels Viking clans) and the witcher
          stronghold of Kaer Morhen.

          Geralt and his mentor Vesemir arrive at the town of White Orchard
          after receiving a letter from Geralt's long-lost lover Yennefer. After
          defeating a griffin for the local Nilfgaardian garrison, Geralt
          accompanies Yennefer to the city of Vizima, where they meet with
          Emperor Emhyr.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emhyr orders Geralt to find Ciri, who is Emhyr's biological daughter
          and Geralt's adopted daughter. Ciri is a Child of the Elder Blood, the
          last heir to an ancient Elven bloodline that grants her the power to
          manipulate time and space, and is being relentlessly stalked by the
          enigmatic Wild Hunt. Geralt learns of three places Ciri was recently
          seen: the war-ravaged swamp province of Velen, the free city-state of
          Novigrad, and the Skellige Isles.

    <p>
      The Witcher is a series of six fantasy novels and 15 short stories written
      by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. The series revolves around the
      eponymous "witcher," Geralt of Rivia. In Sapkowski's works, "witchers" are
      beast hunters who develop supernatural abilities at a young age to battle
      wild beasts and monsters.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Witcher began with a titular 1986 short story that Sapkowski entered
      into a competition held by Fantastyka magazine, marking his debut as an
      author. Due to reader demand, Sapkowski wrote 14 more stories before
      starting a series of novels in 1994. Known as The Witcher Saga, he wrote
      one book a year until the fifth and final installment in 1999. A
      standalone prequel novel, Season of Storms, was published in 2013.

        <p>
          The world is at war and the prophesied savior is nowhere to be found.
          The Witcher, Geralt of Rivia, races to find her in the fourth novel of
          Andrzej Sapkowski's groundbreaking epic fantasy series that inspired
          the hit Netflix show and the blockbuster video games.
        </p>

        <p>
          The world has fallen into war. Ciri, the child of prophecy, has
          vanished. Hunted by friends and foes alike, she has taken on the guise
          of a petty bandit and lives free for the first time in her life.
        </p>

        <p>
          But the net around her is closing. Geralt, the Witcher, has assembled
          a group of allies including Dandelion, Milva, Regis, and Cahir, to
          rescue her. Both sides of the war have sent brutal mercenaries to hunt
          her down. Her crimes have made her famous.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is only one place left to run. The tower of the swallow is
          waiting. . .

          The fifth novel in the New York Times bestselling Witcher series that
          inspired the hit Netflix show finds Ciri trapped in a distant world
          and separated from Geralt and her destiny.
        </p>

        <p>
          After walking through a portal in the Tower of the Swallow, thus
          narrowly escaping death, the Witcher girl, Ciri, finds herself in a
          completely different world... a world of the Elves. She is trapped
          with no way out. Time does not seem to exist and there are no obvious
          borders or portals to cross back into her home world.
        </p>

        <p>
          But this is Ciri, the child of prophecy, and she will not be defeated.
          She knows she must escape to finally rejoin the Witcher, Geralt, and
          his companions - and also to try to conquer her worst nightmare. Leo
          Bonhart, the man who chased, wounded and tortured Ciri, is still on
          her trail.
        </p>

        <p>And the world is still at war.</p>
